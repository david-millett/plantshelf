# plantshelf

Day 1
started on the backend

Day 2
had troubles formatting the database of plants I had generated... took an unexpectedly long time to sort. Had forgotten to put brackets after the text box in bio in the model... this meant that it cuoldnt add my data which contained a bio

decided on adding the ability to sign in with username or email - which required some research to get to work
